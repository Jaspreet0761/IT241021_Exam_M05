Case Study: Configuring Windows 11 Notepad to Prompt Users to Save Files on Close

Background Information:

Issue Reported: Users are not being prompted to save files when closing Notepad in Windows 11 if there are unsaved changes.

Priority Level: Medium (Enhancement Request)

Q2A
A: Do some research on what questions you should ask to make the problem clear.
Remember the question should be specific to the topics above.

Create a file with the URL of the site you looked at and the questions that you should ask the end user.
Commit it.

A2A
I noticed in Win11 that Notepad no longer prompts you to save changes on exit. Is this behavior happening for others and is it by design?
If it's by design, what is the idea behind not at least asking you if you want to save a change?
